# Team 2: Crowd sourced safe cycling map.

Previous work on this in open source at http://github.com/caffeineinc/national-crash-statistics.git

## Defining the problem

 -  We want to display problematic areas for cyclists based on CAS system data from NZTA, plus any crowd-sourced incidents. 
 -  Provide a way for cyclists to identify problematic roads and intersections to avoid.
 -  Identify safe cycling routes in and out of town and city centres.

## Dev work
 - implement postgres, define data structure
 - limit dataset from NZTA to only cycle related data.
 - pull data from postgres and display on the map based on original open maps dataset.
 - build interface for capturing cycle related data 
 - connect interface to underlying IA.
